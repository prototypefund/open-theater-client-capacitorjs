# Open-Theater-Client-CapacitorJS

Demo client to display text, video and audio snippets triggered by the ]OPEN THEATER[ API.

Build in as a WebApp in js, HTML, css wrapped with CapacitorJS to deploy as "native" mobile APP on iOS and Android.

## Repository Structure

To work with CapacitorJS we use `www/` as our base directory.

`www/index.html` is the entry point which will include `www/app.js`

`www/app.js` is the main script that should include and manage all dependencies. 

The App can be used in 3 ways:

1) as a WebApp to be run in the browser
2) as an App wrapped with CapacitorJS for iOS
3) as an App wrapped with CapacitorJS for Android

we will try to build open-theater.js as a bridge module to be imported into any webapp (in our case `www/app.js`) to keep the open-theater API functions and the API functions of different runtime environments (browser, capacitorjs, other wrappers like Kiosk Wrappers etc.) seperate and modular, yet in a consistent js API to be used inside of the main script (`www/app.js`)

### Webpack

This repo utilizes webpack to built `www/app.js`. So don't freak out if this looks a little bit unreadable. You can find the original app.js at `src/app.js` as well as `src/open-theater.js` which is the adapter script that will be included into app.js to bridge between all hardware and framework APIs and the open-theater client functions. 

To build it, open a terminal window, navigate to the root directory of this repository and do: 

```bash
npm install;
npm build;
```

this way `www/app.js` will be build by webpack and webpack will include `open-theater.js` into it.

If you don't like build tools, we understand (we also don't love them): You can also import `open-theater.js` manually as ES6 module into app.js for app.js is included as script of type="module" in Ã¬ndex.html.

If you don't understand what we are talking about, learn about ES6 modules and/or webpack or open an issue. We are also fighting with javascript fatique, so we understand.


### Dependencies

this particular demo client works with CapacitorJS as wrapper around the javascript functions and HTML

in order to create ios and android specific projects, after the above installation process do

```bash
npx cap add ios;
npx cap open ios;
npx cap add android;
npx cap open;
```

this will create the Android Studio (needs to be installed) and XCode (needs to be installed) projects and opens them.

`npm run build` will internally not just do the webpack build, but also call `npx update` which will keep the Android Studio and XCode Projects up-to-date with all changes made inside the javascript and HTML files


## icons & Splashscreens iOS

please change the icon-set if you build your version. You find instructions how to change icons and splashscreens on iOS & Android in capacitorJS on the web, for example here (although the link provided to make the icon sets requires giving them data, so maybe just follow the instructions and create your icons elsewhere): https://www.joshmorony.com/adding-icons-splash-screens-launch-images-to-capacitor-projects/
